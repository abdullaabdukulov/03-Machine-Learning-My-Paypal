# 03-Machine-Learning-My-Paypal

### Task
<p>You have been hired by FriendPay, a competitor of PayPal, to help them improve their credit card fraud identification system. They are having difficulty identifying which transactions are or are not fraudulent, and this is creating significant business problems that are costing them a lot in missed transaction fees.</p>
<p><em>Your Mission</em>
Your mission is to build a fraud detection model using the dataset that has been provided and in doing so, increase revenue from transaction fees.</p>
<p>What are the success criteria?</p>
<ul>
<li>During our next meeting, you will have to show us some data (plot? report?) of what you've been building.</li>
<li>You will also be evaluated on your model's impact on the business. We need to make our customers happy by denying fraudulent transactions and allowing genuine ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>What to expect?</p>
<ul>
<li>A presentation with slides on how you classified, as well as assumptions, implications, and other important information.</li>
<li>Code that the DevOps team should be able to push to production.</li>

</ul>

### Discription
<h2>Technical specification</h2>
<p>Companies that involve a lot of transactions with the use of cards need to find anomalies in the system. Build a fraud detection model on credit cards. Use the transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud to detect if new transactions made by the customer are fraud or not.</p>
